# Release Notes - v0.2.0

## 🚀 What's New in v0.2.0

This is a **major milestone release** that completely reimagines Dashview V2 as an intelligent dashboard framework for Home Assistant. The entire codebase has been rewritten from scratch with modern TypeScript and a modular architecture.

### ✨ Features

  - Number of rooms/areas
  - Complexity score (1-10 scale)
  - List of all detected areas
- **Professional Build System**: Webpack 5 with optimized production builds

#### Backend Enhancements
